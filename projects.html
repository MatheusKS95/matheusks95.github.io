	<h2><strong>Things I Do (or Did)</strong></h2>
	<p>Here is a non-exhaustive list of projects I worked on. I'll subdivide the list in 3 parts: the first,
	personal projects that are open-sourced; the second, proprietary ones and then some closed-source projects
	of my own.</p>
	<br></br>
	<h3>My own open-source projects</h3>

	<h4>SuperBasicMusicPlayer</h4>
	<p>SuperBasicMusicPlayer, or SBMP, is an extremely simplistic music player made for Unix-like systems (might
	work under Windows via MSYS2). This was initially made in a weekend while I was out of internet. Over time, I
	made some small little updates. It can play MP3, FLAC and OGG (Vorbis) music files. Music files can be played
	via terminal parameter or via drag-and-drop.</p>
	<p>It uses Premake as build system. Since it uses very recent versions of SDL2, SDL_mixer and SDL_ttf, it already
	includes such dependencies as static libraries (vendoring), but if you already have the most up-to-date versions
	on your system, you might want to use them instead.</p>

	<h4>VSDSL</h4>
	<p>This project is a data structure library with support for stacks, queues and doubly-linked lists.
	This serves as a guide for other projects of mine that needs some list support. However, none of the
	data structures supported are contiguous in memory, so they are slower than other, contiguous implementations.</p>

	<h4>SpaceCrap</h4>
	<p>SpaceCrap is my first "full" 2D game, written in C with SDL2. It was based on a series of
	tutorials made by Parallel Realities. It's a pretty good tutorial and teaches you how to build an entire game
	with lots of features, including hi-scores. Despite being based on existing code, it was heavily modified, with
	two levels and intermission screens.</p>
	<p>The first level is already a hard one, with swarms of enemy spaceships attacking the player. It follows the idea
	of Capcom's 1943: The Battle of Midway but with spaceships instead of Japanese planes. The second level doesn't have
	enemy swarms but the enemies are extremely powerful.</p>

	</table>

	<h4>SpaceCrap 2</h4>
	<p>SpaceCrap 2 is a simple game that I wrote in C using Raylib as a shared library. This is my first attempt at 
	making a game in 3D without using any full-blown game engine such as Unity/Unreal/Godot. Unlike the first game, 
	which was based on an existing game, SpaceCrap 2 was entirely written from scratch (and trial-and-error, as I was 
	then exploring unknown territories with 3D).</p>
	<p>The game only has one level, which is a boss battle. The player's ship now have 3 weapons and the enemy ship have
	2 but one of them causes insta-death upon contact. SpaceCrap 2 also includes health and shield systems.</p>

	<h4>RallyCrap</h4>
	<p>RallyCrap was my first attempt at making a game without a game engine. It's project written in C++ with SDL2 and 
	Qt framework. It's a simple car "game" with no gameplay content, and the only purpose of this project is learning, 
	setting a pavement for other projects such as SpaceCrap. The game itself uses SDL2, with Qt being used in the "launcher".
	Unlike SpaceCrap and SpaceCrap 2, which was written in C, RallyCrap was written in object-oriented C++. It features
	soundtrack and collision checking with track boundaries.</p>

	<h3>Proprietary Projects</h3>
	<p>These projects are under NDA so I can't give further information.</p>

	<h4>Vulcano</h4>
	<p>Vulcano was a web-based business management tool written in C# (Asp.NET Core) made to help wholesale retailers
	with day-to-day business activities including, but not limited to, inventory and fiscal management. I was tasked with
	inventory submodules, API construction and testing.</p>

			<td>Tool's website</td>
			<td>Not available</td>

			<td>Company</td>
			<td><a href="https://splora.com.br/">Splora Tecnologia</a> - they changed company's goals so Vulcano is not mentioned anymore.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>When I worked on it</td>
			<td>2017-2018</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

	<h4>Sensum Supremo</h4>
	<p>Supremo is a desktop-based business management tool written in C# (WinForms) made with a wider audience in mind (but a lot
	of modules focused around manufacturing and retail). I was tasked with inventory, transport and reporting submodules, with general
	maintenance on fiscal and manufacturing submodules as well.</p>
	<table>

			<td>Tool's website</td>
			<td>Not available (when I was there it was the only tool available for new clients)</td>

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>When I worked on it</td>
			<td>2019-2020</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

	<h4>Time to Fix</h4>
	<p>Time to Fix is a business management tool written in TypeScript (with React) focused on automotive repair shops. It includes
	scheduling and management of cars undergoing maintenance. I worked there briefly, mostly dealing with a report generation tool and
	general bugfixes.</p>

	</table>

	<h3>My own closed-source projects</h3>

	<h4>Project Rockport</h4>
	<p>This is my most ambicious project to date. Project Rockport (codename, as it doesn't have an official name yet) is a racing
	simulator/game engine under development by me. The engine's goal is to have an OpenGL and SDL3 rendering backend (when SDL3 comes up
	with it's own rendering soon), physics engine with focus on automotive physics and audio engine that's still in it's infancy. It's
	written in C. It's still too early for being showcased, but in it's current state I have partial OpenGL renderer with some working
	PBR shaders and a stripped-down IQM model loader (being replaced by a GLTF one).</p>
	<p>It's currently a personal, proprietary project but, when the day to make it public comes, it'll be probably open-sourced under either
	GNU GPL or MPL licence.</p>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td>Status</td>
			<td>Under development</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>When</td>
			<td>Since 2019 (codenamed as Project Rockport since 2023)</td>
		</tr>
