	<h2><strong>Project Rockport</strong></h2>
	<p>Project Rockport is my most ambitious project. The goal is to make a racing simulation-focused game engine
	(with a game to showcase it). Architecture-wise, it's still in it's infancy, with the rendering engine being
	re-written. The chosen language is C with plug-ins written in Lua.</p>
	<p>Originally, the graphics engine used OpenGL 4.1 but now I'm moving towards the use of WGPU-native because
	it offers a modern API without exposing "bare metal" stuff (unlike Vulkan and DX12). There's also SDL's GPU
	API which may (or may not) come soon and I also want to check it out.</p>
	<p>Some utility modules are complete. The <a href="https://github.com/MatheusKS95/simple3dmath">math module</a>
	is publicly available under the MPL license.</p>
	<p>I plan to make a 3D audio engine using either <a href="https://github.com/mackron/miniaudio">miniaudio</a> or
	<a href="http://openal-soft.org/">OpenAL-Soft</a>.</p>
	<p>When it comes to physics, that's a gigantic beast to beat down, and pose a much bigger challenge than the
	graphics, specially when it comes to simulating cars. That's a lot to study. The plan is to make something from
	the ground up but if needed I'll use <a href="https://www.ode.org/">Open Dynamics Engine</a> or something similar
	to help me.</p>
	<p>Project Rockport is a codename. I have no idea for a final name at the moment. Why Rockport? It's a reference
	to another famous racing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_for_Speed:_Most_Wanted_(2005_video_game)">
	game</a> (however the projects are not similar in scope).</p>
	<p>There's nothing new to show up, but I have a screenshot from an earlier version, back when it still used
	OpenGL and used an unfinished PBR pipeline (that's why it looks so weird). The screenshot is down below -- ignore
	the gun, it was for testing 3D model loading:</p>
