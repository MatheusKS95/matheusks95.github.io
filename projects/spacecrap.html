	<h2><strong>SpaceCrap</strong></h2>
	<p>SpaceCrap is a series, with 2 games released so far. Both follow the premise of a below-standard spaceship
	having to fight powerful enemies.</p>

	<h3>SpaceCrap</h3>
	<p>The first title. SpaceCrap was my first "full" 2D game, written in C with SDL2. It was based on a series of
	tutorials made by Parallel Realities. It's a pretty good tutorial and teaches you how to build an entire game
	with lots of features, including hi-scores. Despite being based on existing code, it was heavily modified, with
	two levels and intermission screens.</p>
	<p>It's a shoot-em-up game where you must bring your defective ship, SpaceCrap, to a place in order to have it
	fixed. However, you meet some space pirates on the way and you have to eliminate them in order to proceed.</p>
	<p>I no longer work with this particular one.</p>

	<h3>SpaceCrap 2</h3>
	<p>SpaceCrap 2 is a simple game that I made, this time written in C using raylib. This is my first attempt at
	making a game in 3D without using any full-blown game engine such as Unity/Unreal/Godot. Unlike the first game,
	which was based on an existing game, SpaceCrap 2 was entirely written from scratch (and trial-and-error, as I was
	then exploring unknown territories with 3D).</p>
	<p>The game only has one level, which is a boss battle. The player's ship now have 3 weapons and the enemy ship have
	2 but one of them causes insta-death upon contact. SpaceCrap 2 also includes health and shield systems. The plot is
	a follow-up of the previous game.</p>
	<p>This game no longer works, since it requires an outdated raylib version. I plan to update it soon.</p>

	<h3>SpaceCrap Remake</h3>
	<p>SpaceCrap Remake is a total remake I'm planning to work on after the update on SpaceCrap 2 is done.</p>
	<p>I plan to re-tell the story from the first game and merge the boss battle of the second game into a single-player
	browser game. I also plan to use pattern-based bullet hell gameplay similar to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNKyPkQ-_ug">
	Touhou games</a>.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, I have no plans for a release date at the moment.</p>
